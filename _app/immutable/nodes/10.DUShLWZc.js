Here is a quick guide on how to prepare espresso and froth milk.</p> <h3>Starting the Coffee Machine:</h3> <ul><li>Turn on the machine using the power switch on the front.</li> <li>Wait until the machine heats up to 93 degrees. The current status and temperature are displayed on the screen.</li></ul> <h3>Preparing Espresso:</h3> <ul><li>In the cabinet above the coffee machine, you will find coffee beans - both regular and decaffeinated coffee.</li> <li>Fill the coffee container with the selected coffee. You can use an espresso cup as a measuring cup to measure the right amount.</li> <li>For a single shot espresso, you should use the special single-shot filter basket located in the removable drip tray. For a double espresso (Double Shot) or two cups, use the regular filter basket.</li> <li>Insert the portafilter into the brew group.</li> <li>Select the desired cup size. The corresponding coffee cups can also be found in the cabinet above the coffee machine.</li> <li>The grind size has been set for decaffeinated coffee. If the extraction runs too fast, adjust to a finer grind size using the left control (lower number). If it runs too slow, adjust to a coarser grind size (higher number).</li> <li>For a single shot espresso, press the 1-cup button (30 seconds extraction). For a double espresso or two cups, use the 2-cup button (40 seconds extraction).</li></ul> <h3>Frothing Milk:</h3> <ul><li>Fill the milk pitcher up to the mark with milk. For using oat milk, you can use Oatly Barista Oat Milk from the pantry in the hallway.</li> <li>Position the milk pitcher under the milk frother and select the desired froth level.</li> <li>Start the milk frother (turn the right control down for automatic operation; up for manual operation) and wait until the milk reaches the perfect consistency and the temperature does not exceed 65 degrees Celsius.</li> <li>After each frothing, clean the frothing nozzle with a wet cloth.</li></ul> <p>Now you can combine your espresso with the frothed milk to create the perfect cappuccino or latte macchiato. Enjoy your coffee!</p>";return{c(){e=h("div"),e.innerHTML=i,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(e)!=="svelte-1q0754g"&&(e.innerHTML=i),this.h()},h(){f(e,"class","container")},m(t,a){p(t,e,a)},p:o,i:o,o,d(t){t&&d(e)}}}class w extends n{constructor(e){super(),l(this,e,null,m,s,{})}}export{w as component};
