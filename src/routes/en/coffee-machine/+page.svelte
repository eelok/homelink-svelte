	<h1>Coffee Machine - User Guide</h1>
	<p>
		Our Sage The Oracle coffee machine allows you to enjoy barista-quality coffee right in our
		kitchen. Here is a quick guide on how to prepare espresso and froth milk.
	</p>
	<h2>Starting the Coffee Machine:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Turn on the machine using the power switch on the front.</li>
		<li>
			Wait until the machine heats up to 93 degrees. The current status and temperature are
			displayed on the screen.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Preparing Espresso:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In the cabinet above the coffee machine, you will find coffee beans - both regular and
			decaffeinated coffee.
		</li>
		<li>
			Fill the coffee container with the selected coffee. You can use an espresso cup as a measuring
			cup to measure the right amount.
		</li>
		<li>
			For a single shot espresso, you should use the special single-shot filter basket located in
			the removable drip tray. For a double espresso (Double Shot) or two cups, use the regular
			filter basket.
		</li>
		<li>Insert the portafilter into the brew group.</li>
		<li>
			Select the desired cup size. The corresponding coffee cups can also be found in the cabinet
			above the coffee machine.
		</li>
		<li>
			The grind size has been set for decaffeinated coffee. If the extraction runs too fast, adjust
			to a finer grind size using the left control (lower number). If it runs too slow, adjust to a
			coarser grind size (higher number).
		</li>
		<li>
			For a single shot espresso, press the 1-cup button (30 seconds extraction). For a double
			espresso or two cups, use the 2-cup button (40 seconds extraction).
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Frothing Milk:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Fill the milk pitcher up to the mark with milk. For using oat milk, you can use Oatly Barista
			Oat Milk from the pantry in the hallway.
		</li>
		<li>Position the milk pitcher under the milk frother and select the desired froth level.</li>
		<li>
			Start the milk frother (turn the right control down for automatic operation; up for manual
			operation) and wait until the milk reaches the perfect consistency and the temperature does
			not exceed 65 degrees Celsius.
		</li>
		<li>After each frothing, clean the frothing nozzle with a wet cloth.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Now you can combine your espresso with the frothed milk to create the perfect cappuccino or
		latte macchiato. Enjoy your coffee!
