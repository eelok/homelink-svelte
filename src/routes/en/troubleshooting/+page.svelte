        <h2>Microwave Safety Switch Issue</h2>
        <p>If the microwave stops working, it may have triggered the safety switch. To resolve this:</p>
        <p>In the entryway, on the wall opposite the front door, you'll find a small door in the wall above the telephone. This is the safety switch box. Open it and look for a switch in the down position. Flip this switch back up. You should now be able to use the microwave again.</p>
